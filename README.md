# Just Run

Project made during 72 hour game jam.

Death is inevitable. Everything around you is dead and the game will always end with your death. Wander until you die.

It's a 3D first person game where you need to navigate dungeons that have been randomly selected. There are zombies and spikes and traps that make this hard.

Move with WASD and mouse or use a controller (its better). Press enter or start on the main menu to start the game. (press R to reset level)
